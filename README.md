# AutoGluon: Empowering Multimodal AutoML for the Next 10 Million Users

Automated machine learning (AutoML) offers the promise of translating raw data into accurate predictions without the need for 
significant human effort, expertise, and manual experimentation. In this workshop, we introduce [AutoGluon](https://github.com/awslabs/autogluon), 
a state-of-the-art and easy-to-use toolkit that empowers *multimodal* AutoML. Different from most AutoML systems that focus on solving tabular tasks 
containing categorical and numerical features, we consider supervised learning tasks on various types of data including tabular 
features, text, image, timeseries, as well as their combinations. We will introduce the real-world problems that AutoGluon can help you 
solve within three lines of code and the fundamental techniques adopted in the toolkit.
Rather than diving deep into the mechanisms underlining each individual ML models, 
we emphasize on how you can take advantage of a diverse collection of models to build an automated ML pipeline.
Our workshop will also emphasize on the techniques behind automatically building and training deep learning models, 
which are powerful yet cumbersome to manage manually.

Join us at the [NeurIPS 2022](https://nips.cc/) located at New Orleans Ernest N. Morial Convention Center on Monday, November 28 at 2:00pm, CST in 
Room 293.


## Schedule

For each section, there will be a 10-15min QA at the end of section. For hands-on tutorials, 
we will provide notebooks for you to try out AutoGluon via [SageMaker Studio Lab](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/studio-lab/) for [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
